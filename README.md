# elm-calculator

This is my first elm project: a simple stack-based calculator.

To build it locally, install elm and then execute `elm-reactor`. To
create `elm.js`, which is required for the stand-alone `index.html` to
work, you need to execute `elm-make Main.elm`. Of course, you should
be using emacs with [elm-mode](https://github.com/jcollard/elm-mode)
so you just need to remember a number of cryptic commands ;-)
